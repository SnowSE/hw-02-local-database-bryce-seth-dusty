Notes on running our project:

Web API must be ran through the command line (and not selected as a multiple startup project). We are not sure why this is.Â 

API needs to be running to run Maui App and Unit Tests.

To run the Tests, you have to go through the command line. They will not show up as tests in the test explorer.

Do not grade the Blazor web app. That was quickly abandoned when we realized it was not a requirement.
